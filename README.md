(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) for improving existing process problems with unknown causes.

### Article
In this [Article](https://www.samirsaci.com/lean-six-sigma-with-python-logistic-regression/), we will implement Logistic 
Regression with Python to estimate the impact of a daily productivity bonus on your warehouse operators picking productivity.

### Scenario
You are Reginal Director of a Logistic Company (3PL) and you have 22 warehouses in your scope.

</p>

In each warehouse, the site manager has fixed a picking productivity target for the operators; your objective is to find the right incentive policy to reach 75% of this target.
P.S: Picking Productivity is defined by the number of cartons picked per hour paid.

### Objective: find the right incentive policy
Currently, productive operators (operators that reach their daily productivity target) receive 5 euros per day in addition to their daily salary of 64 euros (after-tax).
However, this incentive policy applied in 2 warehouses is not that effective; only 20% of the operators are reaching this target.
#### Question
What should be the minimum daily bonus needed to reach 75% of the picking productivity target?
#### Experiment
Randomly select operators in your 22 warehouses
#### Implement a daily incentive amount varying between 1 to 20 euros
Check if the operators reached their target
